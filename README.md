The aim of this tutorial is to provide a quick start guide to R users interested in creating packages by learning only the essentials. 
The user is expected to already know how to code in R.

For more details about package creation, please refer to [R Packages - by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

This Tutorial was written using Rmarkdown, and while it is compiled, it actually creates the R package called 'firstPkg'.
